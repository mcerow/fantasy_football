# Fantasy Football Weekly Analysis

This repo contains the notebooks associated with collecting, cleaning and analyzing weekly football stats to make decisions for my fantasy football team.

I scraped data from the following site and then merged dataframes later in the exploratory data analysis process.

 - [Pro Football Reference](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/2020/fantasy.htm)
 - [Fantasy Pros](https://www.fantasypros.com/nfl/reports/leaders/?year=2020&start=1&end=1)
 - [Lineups](https://www.lineups.com/nfl/team-stats/defense)
 - [ESPN](https://www.espn.com/nfl/stats/team/_/view/defense)
 - [CBS Sports](https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/stats/player/kicking/nfl/regular/all/)

Each week following Monday Night Football, I scrape each site to get updated season to date stats on each offenive player and defense. I grab the week over week fntasy points accumulated by each player/defense and analyze not only the players on my team but the available players in my league.
